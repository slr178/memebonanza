## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click the "SPIN" button to start the slot machine spinning
3. The slots will spin once and stop at their final positions
4. Click the button again to reset and spin again

## How It Works

### Single-Spin Mechanism
- Each slot animation runs exactly once (`animation-iteration-count: 1`)
- Animations stay at their final position (`animation-fill-mode: forwards`)
- Animations are paused by default (`animation-play-state: paused`)
- Clicking the button toggles the checkbox, which triggers animations to run
- Unchecking resets all slots back to their starting positions

## File Structure

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html    # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css    # All styling and animations

```

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
- CSS Transforms and 3D Transforms
- CSS Animations
- CSS Grid and Flexbox

## Customization

You can customize various aspects by modifying the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

- `--machine-width`: Width of the slot machine
- `--spin-steps`: Number of steps in the spin animation
- `--delay-2nd-slot` through `--delay-5th-slot`: Delays for each slot's animation
- Color gradients and other visual properties

## Animation Details

The slot machine includes several types of animations:
- **Spin Animation**: The main slot spinning effect with stepped motion
- **Background Effect**: Subtle pulsing light effect in the background
- **Button Hover**: Smooth lift effect when hovering over the spin button
- **Golden Frame**: Glowing effect around the slot machine border

## Game Mechanics

### Weighted Outcomes
The slot machine uses a weighted random system with the following probabilities:

| Symbol Group | Weight | Payout (% of pool) | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| S-triple | 8% | 0.05% | Three S symbols in a row |
| O-triple | 5% | 0.10% | Three O symbols in a row |
| L-triple | 3% | 0.30% | Three L symbols in a row |
| Trump/Elon | 1% | 1.00% | Three Trump or Elon symbols |
| Popcat/Dog | 0.2% | 10.00% | Three Popcat or Dogwifhat symbols |
| No Win | 82.8% | 0% | No matching symbols |

**Note**: PEPE (figure-8) is the top premium symbol but is not included in the weighted outcomes system. It only appears randomly as a "loser" symbol, making it extremely rare to get multiple PEPEs in a winning line.

### Winning Mechanics
- Wins occur when 3 matching symbols appear in the middle row (row 3) in columns 2-4
- If 4 symbols match: payout is scaled by 4/3
- If 5 symbols match: payout is scaled by 5/3
- Win sound effect plays on successful matches

Enjoy your modern slot machine! ðŸŽ°
